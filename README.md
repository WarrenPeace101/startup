Imagine you are all alone in your basement, trying to get the absolute perfect run. You've spent hours hopping across lily pads and side-stepping semi-trucks. You finally did it! A new high score! All is well in the world. And then your grandpa scoffs from the back of the room, saying that he can do it better. A direct challenge to your pride. You must respond.

Now presenting **multiplayer Frogger**! :frog: This is a remake of the classic arcade game, with the addition of a multiplayer interface! :frog: :frog: Different players can each login to the game with their personal froggy and try their hand at the course! The frogs will then maneuver themselves through the obstacles, trying to reach the end of the course. Think you have what it takes to beat your grandpa? Come play and find out!

May the best froggy win! Watch out for cars! ðŸš™

## Startup Notes

I've had a lot of fun (and a little bit of sweat) learning the different CSS elements. I combined different elements together to create a frog, a truck, a car, and some other stuff! I also played around with the borders of the page for a while (using flex and relative), even though they are still a little off. I've learned that changing even one tiny detail in the CSS can completely throw off the entire page, so I'm not sure if I'll change it much more. But still I think it's super cool that you can have so much customizaiton.

## Simon Project

So far I've played around with the raw HTML files from the Simon project. I messed with the SVG, changing the shapes of the Simon buttons. I also played around with various minor features, such as tweeking the scoreboard. I really enjoyed updating the icon to Simon Peter hehe. So far I've learned basic HTML formatting, and why something like CSS is so necessary. I also think that the script for uploading files to my server is pretty cool.

I've continued with Simon 2.0 by updating the CSS of the project. I utilized a little bit of Bootstrap and some personal selectors, changing the theme of the game to a maroon color. I made the scoreboard stand out more from the background with border colors, as well as changing the size and alignment of the about page. I enjoyed making the navigation bar in the header using the flex property, as well by alternating between visible and invisible sections. I also really like the shadow text effect for the main title.

The JavaScript for my Simon project was a bit of a hassle. I ended up backing up my version of the game (HTML / CSS) and using the demo version for simplicity. Even so I spent a while debugging. I think the problem was that I forgot to include the sound files, which resulted in an await that never fully executed. There might have also been some kind of problem with the JSON file which prevented it from displaying the scoreboard. Regardless, I learned that JavaScript has a lot of power, and that I can really lose myself messing around with all the minor details. I'm excited to mess around with some of these features in my Frogger.
