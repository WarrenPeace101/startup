Imagine you are all alone in your basement, trying to get the absolute perfect run. You've spent hours hopping across lily pads and side-stepping semi-trucks. You finally did it! A new high score! All is well in the world. And then your grandpa scoffs from the back of the room, saying that he can do it better. A direct challenge to your pride. You must respond.

Now presenting **multiplayer Frogger**! :frog: This is a remake of the classic arcade game, with the addition of a multiplayer interface! :frog: :frog: Different players can each login to the game with their personal froggy and try their hand at the course! The frogs will then maneuver themselves through the obstacles, trying to reach the end of the course. Think you have what it takes to beat your grandpa? Come play and find out!

May the best froggy win! Watch out for cars! ðŸš™

## Simon Project

So far I've played around with the raw HTML files from the Simon project. I messed with the SVG, changing the shapes of the Simon buttons. I also played around with various minor features, such as tweeking the scoreboard. I really enjoyed updating the icon to Simon Peter hehe. So far I've learned basic HTML formatting, and why something like CSS is so necessary. I also think that the script for uploading files to my server is pretty cool.
