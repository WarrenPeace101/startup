Imagine you are all alone in your basement, trying to get the absolute perfect run. You've spent hours hopping across lilly pads and side-stepping semi-trucks. You finally did it! A new high score! All is well in the world. And then your grandpa scoffs from the back of the room, saying that he can do it better. A direct challenge to your pride. You must respond.

My the best froggy win! Watch out for cars! üöô

Welcome to my startup project! I plan on cre'ating the classing game of **Frogger** :frog:, and extending it to include '#008000' multiple frogs at once! üê∏ :frog: The winner will be the frog who collects the most points! 


This was a good assignment! I learned a lot about what GitHub is, and how it can be super powerful for coordinating efforts among a programming team. I appreciated the value of good communication among your team (to avoid merge errors). I also thought more about my startup project, and how I plan on implementing certain aspects to Frogger.
