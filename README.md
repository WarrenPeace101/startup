# My Startup project: Multiplayer Frogger

Welcome to my startup project! I plan on creating the classing game of **Frogger** :frog:, and extending it to include multiple frogs at once! üê∏ :frog: The winner will be the frog who collects the most points! Watch out for cars! üöô

Frogs have feelings too. Ribbit ribbit.

This was a good assignment! I learned a lot about what GitHub is, and how it can be super powerful for coordinating efforts among a programming team. I appreciated the value of good communication among your team (to avoid merge errors). I also thought more about my startup project, and how I plan on implementing certain aspects to Frogger.
